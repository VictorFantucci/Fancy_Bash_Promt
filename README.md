## DESCRIPTION:
	This script updates your "PS1" environment variable to display colors.
	Addicitionally, it also shortens the name of your current part to maximum
	25 characters, which is quite useful when working in deeply nested folders.



## INSTALLATION:
	Copy this script to your home folder and rename it to ".fancy-bash-promt.sh"
	Run this command from any terminal:
		echo "source ~/.fancy-bash-promt.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

	Alternatively, copy the content of this file into your .bashrc file



## FUNCTIONS:

    * bash_prompt_command()
	  This function takes your current working directory and stores a shortened
	  version in the variable "NEW_PWD".

	* format_font()
	  A small helper function to generate color formating codes from simple
	  number codes (defined below as local variables for convenience).

	* bash_prompt()
	  This function colorizes the bash promt. The exact color scheme can be
	  configured here. The structure of the function is as follows:
		1. A. Definition of available colors for 16 bits.
		1. B. Definition of some colors for 256 bits (add your own).
		2. Configuration >> EDIT YOUR PROMT HERE<<.
		4. Generation of color codes.
		5. Generation of window title (some terminal expect the first
		   part of $PS1 to be the window title)
		6. Formating of the bash promt ($PS1).

	* Main script body:
	  It calls the adequate helper functions to colorize your promt and sets
	  a hook to regenerate your working directory "NEW_PWD" when you change it.
